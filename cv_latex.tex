	I am an undergraduate student whose interests have been motivated by courses I took based on the easiness of getting grades, coupled with a significant bias-of-the-herd. To be specific, I am interested in \textsc{UselessTopic, UninterestingTopic}, and \textsc{DifficultTopic}\footnote{so that my classmates respect me}.\\
