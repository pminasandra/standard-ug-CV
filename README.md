# standard-ug-CV

## Context
This CV template was prepared after a lot of discussion with multiple faculty members at the [Indian Institute of Science](https://iisc.ac.in). It is deigned keeping applications to graduate programmes in mind, but might also be used for applications to exchange programmes, and other events that require a CV.

## Content
In the interest of humour, and to not disclose personal details unnecessarily, I've made this document a parody of a random undergraduate student's CV. _None_ of the content on this template applies to me, and is not intended to offend anyone. If all goes well, it actually won't offend anyone. The pdf version of this template _might_ appear in Quarks - the IISc UG magazine, in the 2018 edition.

## Licences
Please acknowledge me when you tell your friends about this template. Apart from that, modify it and share it as many times as you like.

## Technicalities
The language used is LaTeX, and compilation works best with running `pdflatex` 3 times on the file in a Linux system. 

## Final note
If you make any improvements with this template, do let me know! Feedback is always useful.
